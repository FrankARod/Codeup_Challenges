#Codeup Challenges

My attempts at the challenges described in [this page](https://github.com/gocodeup/codeup_challenges)

##Alphabet Soup  
Runs from REPL. Asks the user for a series of words and rearranges the characters of each word by alphabetical order. If run from OSX the rearranged word is said back to the user.

##Blackjack  
Runs from REPL. A simple PHP blackjack game.
